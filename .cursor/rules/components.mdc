## Component Development Guidelines

- **Styling**: Always use Tailwind CSS for styling.
- **UI Primitives**: Utilize `shadcn/ui` primitives.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure components are accessible (WCAG AA).
- **Mobile-First**: Design with a mobile-first approach.
- **Structure**:
    - Props interface at the top.
    - Component as a named export.
    - JSDoc/TSDoc for the component and its props.
- **State Management**: Prefer local component state or React Context for simple cases. For more complex global state, consider Zustand or other established libraries if already in use in the project.
- **Client Components**: Only use `"use client"` when strictly necessary (e.g., for hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, or event handlers). Prefer Server Components for better performance.
