## Supabase Migration Guidelines

- **Naming**: Store all migrations in `supabase/migrations/` with timestamped names (e.g., `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_descriptive_name.sql`).
- **SQL Functions**:
    - Always use `SECURITY INVOKER`.
    - Include `SET search_path = '';` (or `SET search_path = public;` if appropriate, but be explicit) at the beginning of function definitions to ensure a clean search path.
    - Never hard-code UUIDs or secrets. Use parameters or look them up from other tables if necessary.
- **RLS (Row Level Security)**:
    - Activate RLS on every new table: `ALTER TABLE your_table_name ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;`
    - Document RLS policies next to the table DDL (as comments in the migration file or in a separate policy file referenced by the migration).
    - Ensure default-deny: if no policies match, access should be denied.
- **Idempotency**: Write migration scripts to be idempotent where possible. For example, use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` or check for existence before creating/altering objects.
- **Transactions**: Wrap migration steps in transactions (`BEGIN; ... COMMIT;` or `ROLLBACK;` on error) to ensure atomicity, especially for multi-statement migrations.
- **Comments**: Add comments to explain complex DDL or non-obvious choices.
