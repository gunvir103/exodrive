# Next.js 15 Parameters Upgrade

## Overview
This document describes the changes made to upgrade the ExoDrive DocuSeal integration project to be compatible with Next.js 15's new parameter handling.

## Breaking Change in Next.js 15
In Next.js 15, dynamic route parameters (`params`) and search parameters (`searchParams`) are now Promises that need to be awaited before use.

### Before (Next.js 14 and earlier)
```typescript
export async function GET(
  request: NextRequest,
  { params }: { params: { bookingId: string } }
) {
  const { bookingId } = params; // Direct access
  // ... rest of the code
}
```

### After (Next.js 15)
```typescript
export async function GET(
  request: NextRequest,
  { params }: { params: Promise<{ bookingId: string }> }
) {
  const { bookingId } = await params; // Must await the Promise
  // ... rest of the code
}
```

## Files Modified

### Dynamic Route Handlers Fixed
The following API route files with dynamic segments were updated:

1. **`app/api/admin/bookings/[bookingId]/route.ts`**
   - Updated GET, PATCH, and DELETE functions
   - Changed `params: { bookingId: string }` to `params: Promise<{ bookingId: string }>`
   - Added `await` when accessing `bookingId`

2. **`app/api/admin/bookings/[bookingId]/status/route.ts`**
   - Updated POST function
   - Applied same Promise pattern for params

3. **`app/api/cars/[carId]/route.ts`**
   - Updated GET function for car details
   - Changed params to Promise type and added await

4. **`app/api/cars/[carId]/reviews/route.ts`**
   - Updated GET and POST functions
   - Fixed params access pattern

5. **`app/api/bookings/[bookingId]/capture-payment/route.ts`**
   - Updated POST function for payment capture
   - Applied Promise pattern

6. **`app/api/bookings/[bookingId]/void-payment/route.ts`**
   - Updated POST function for payment voiding
   - Applied Promise pattern

## Migration Scripts

Two scripts were created to automate the migration:

### 1. `scripts/fix-nextjs15-params.ts`
Initial script that:
- Finds all dynamic route files
- Updates function signatures to use Promise types
- Adds await statements for params access

### 2. `scripts/fix-nextjs15-complete.ts`
Comprehensive script that:
- Handles specific edge cases
- Ensures all params destructuring uses await
- Fixes both arrow functions and regular function declarations

## Running the Migration

To apply these fixes to your codebase:

```bash
# Make the scripts executable
chmod +x scripts/fix-nextjs15-complete.ts

# Run the migration script
bun run scripts/fix-nextjs15-complete.ts
```

## Verification

After applying the fixes:

1. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   bun run build
   ```
   The build should complete successfully without parameter-related errors.

2. **Run tests**:
   ```bash
   bun test
   ```
   Tests should pass (note: some tests may fail for unrelated reasons like missing environment variables).

## Additional Considerations

### Search Parameters
While not changed in this migration, be aware that `searchParams` in page components also becomes a Promise in Next.js 15:

```typescript
// Page component
export default async function Page({
  searchParams,
}: {
  searchParams: Promise<{ [key: string]: string | string[] | undefined }>
}) {
  const params = await searchParams;
  // Use params...
}
```

### Middleware and Layouts
These changes primarily affect:
- API route handlers with dynamic segments
- Page components with dynamic routes
- generateMetadata functions

Static routes and client components are not affected by this change.

## Benefits of the Change

While this is a breaking change, the Promise-based approach offers benefits:
1. **Better performance**: Allows Next.js to optimize parameter resolution
2. **Improved streaming**: Enables better streaming and partial rendering
3. **Type safety**: More accurate TypeScript types for async operations

## Support

If you encounter any issues with the parameter migration:
1. Check that all dynamic route files have been updated
2. Ensure you're using `await` when accessing params
3. Verify the Promise type is correctly specified in function signatures
4. Review the build output for any remaining parameter-related errors
