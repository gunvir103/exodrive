# DocuSeal Integration Documentation

## Overview

The ExoDrive platform integrates with DocuSeal for automated rental agreement generation and e-signature collection. This integration ensures that every booking has a legally binding contract that is automatically generated after payment authorization and tracked through completion.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```env
# DocuSeal API Configuration
DOCUSEAL_API_URL=https://api.docuseal.com
DOCUSEAL_API_TOKEN=your-api-token
DOCUSEAL_TEMPLATE_ID=1228139
DOCUSEAL_WEBHOOK_SECRET=ds_whsec_7K9mXpQ2vN5bR8tL3jF6wY4hA1sD0gE2
COMPANY_EMAIL=contracts@exodriveexotics.com
```

### Webhook Configuration

Configure the following webhook URL in your DocuSeal dashboard:

```

## Template Field Mapping

The rental agreement template (ID: 1228139) contains fields that are handled in two ways for security:

### System Pre-Filled Fields (Non-Sensitive)
| Template Field Name | Data Source | Example Value | Security Status |
|-------------------|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| `vehicle_make` | `cars.make` | "Ferrari" | âœ… Safe to transmit |

- `Additional Vehicle Operator`
- `Additional Driver's License`
- `Additional Phone Number`
- `Additional Address`

### Signature Fields
- Primary Renter Signature (Required)

## Admin API Endpoints

### Generate Contract
```http
POST /api/admin/contracts
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "action": "generate",
  "bookingId": "uuid-here"
}

Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "submissionId": "12345",
  "message": "Contract generated and sent successfully"
}
```

### Resend Contract

  "success": true,
  "message": "Contract reminder sent successfully"
}
```

### Get Contract Status
```http
GET /api/admin/contracts?bookingId=uuid-here

Response:
{
  "success": true,
  "status": "completed",
  "data": {
    "id": 12345,

    }
  ]
}
```

## Webhook Processing

### Webhook Handler: `/api/webhooks/docuseal/route.ts`

The webhook handler processes the following events:

#### Event: `submission.created`
- Updates `contract_status` to `sent`
- Stores submission ID
- Logs contract generation event

#### Event: `submission.viewed`
- Updates `contract_status` to `viewed`
- Logs view event with timestamp

#### Event: `submission.completed`
- Updates `contract_status` to `signed`
- Stores signed document URL
- Creates `booking_media` record for PDF
- Updates `overall_status` to `upcoming` if payment is authorized

#### Event: `submission.expired`
- Updates `contract_status` to `expired`
- Logs expiration event

#### Event: `submission.archived`
- Logs archive event
- No status update

### Webhook Security
- HMAC-SHA256 signature verification
- Idempotency checks
- Rate limiting
- Secure payload validation

## Automation Workflow

### Automatic Contract Generation

Contracts are automatically generated when:

1. **Payment Authorization** (Default Flow)
   - Triggered via PayPal webhook when payment is authorized
   - Contract sent immediately after successful payment
   - Customer receives email with signing link

2. **Manual Generation** (Admin Override)
   - Admin can manually generate contracts from dashboard
   - Used for special cases or regeneration

### Contract Lifecycle

```
1. Payment Authorized â†’ Contract Generated
2. Email Sent â†’ Status: "sent"
3. Customer Opens Email â†’ Status: "viewed"
4. Customer Signs â†’ Status: "signed"
5. PDF Stored â†’ Booking Confirmed
```

### Status Tracking

Contract statuses in database:
- `not_sent`: Initial state
- `sent`: Email delivered
- `viewed`: Customer opened document
- `signed`: Agreement completed
- `declined`: Customer declined
- `expired`: Signing deadline passed

## Database Schema

### Booking Table Fields
```sql
-- Contract-related columns in bookings table
docuseal_submission_id TEXT,        -- DocuSeal submission ID
contract_status TEXT,                -- Current contract status
contract_sent_at TIMESTAMP,          -- When contract was sent
contract_document_url TEXT           -- Signed PDF URL
```

### Booking Media Storage
```sql
-- Signed contracts stored in booking_media
INSERT INTO booking_media (
  booking_id,
  media_type,
  file_url,
  file_name,
  metadata
) VALUES (
  'booking-uuid',
  'signed_contract',
  'https://docuseal.com/documents/...',
  'rental-agreement.pdf',
  '{"docuseal_submission_id": 12345}'
);
```

## Error Handling

### Common Errors and Solutions

#### 1. Template Not Found
```json
{
  "error": "DocuSeal API error: 404 - Template not found"
}
```
**Solution**: Verify `DOCUSEAL_TEMPLATE_ID` in environment variables

#### 2. Invalid API Token
```json
{
  "error": "DocuSeal API error: 401 - Unauthorized"
}
```
**Solution**: Check `DOCUSEAL_API_TOKEN` is valid

#### 3. Contract Already Exists
```json
{
  "error": "Contract already generated for this booking"
}
```
**Solution**: Use resend functionality instead of generate

#### 4. Customer Data Missing
```json
{
  "error": "Booking not found: Customer information incomplete"
}
```
**Solution**: Ensure customer profile is complete before generating contract

### Retry Strategy

Failed contract generations are logged but don't fail the payment webhook. Admins can:
1. View failed attempts in booking events
2. Manually regenerate contracts
3. Use bulk contract generation for multiple bookings

## Testing

### Test Environment Setup
1. Use DocuSeal sandbox account
2. Set test template ID in `.env.local`
3. Configure test webhook endpoint

### Test Scenarios
1. **Happy Path**: Payment â†’ Contract â†’ Sign â†’ Complete
2. **Reminder Flow**: Generate â†’ Wait â†’ Resend â†’ Sign
3. **Decline Flow**: Generate â†’ Customer Declines â†’ Handle
4. **Expiry Flow**: Generate â†’ No Action â†’ Expires â†’ Regenerate

### Webhook Testing
```bash
# Test webhook signature verification
curl -X POST http://localhost:3005/api/webhooks/docuseal \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-docuseal-signature: test-signature" \
  -d '{
    "event_type": "submission.completed",
    "data": {
      "id": 12345,
      "metadata": {"booking_id": "test-booking-id"}
    }
  }'
```

## Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Track
- Contract generation success rate
- Time to signature (generation â†’ completion)
- Reminder effectiveness
- Decline/expiry rates
- API response times

### Dashboard Indicators
- Pending contracts count
- Overdue signatures
- Failed generation attempts
- Daily contract volume

## Best Practices

### 1. PII Security & Privacy
- **Never transmit PII to cloud services** - Customer fills sensitive data directly in DocuSeal
- **Admin verification required** - All PII fields reviewed manually before rental approval
- **Data minimization principle** - Only send necessary non-sensitive information
- **Secure field completion** - Customers enter PII directly in DocuSeal's secure interface

### 2. Data Validation
- Validate only non-sensitive customer data before generation
- Verify email addresses and phone numbers are valid
- Ensure all required non-PII fields are populated

### 2. Timing
- Generate contracts immediately after payment
- Send reminders after 24 hours if unsigned
- Set expiry to 7 days for urgency

### 3. Communication
- Include booking details in email subject
- Add urgency messaging for expiring contracts
- Provide clear signing instructions

### 4. Error Recovery
- Log all generation attempts
- Implement manual retry from admin panel
- Monitor webhook delivery health

### 5. Security
- Never expose API tokens in client code
- Verify all webhook signatures
- Use secure storage for signed documents
- Implement access controls for downloads

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: Webhooks Not Received
1. Check webhook URL configuration in DocuSeal
2. Verify webhook secret matches
3. Check server logs for signature failures
4. Test with ngrok for local development

### Issue: Contracts Not Generating
1. Check API token validity
2. Verify template exists and is active
3. Review booking data completeness
4. Check error logs in booking_events

### Issue: Customers Not Receiving Emails
1. Verify customer email address
2. Check DocuSeal email delivery logs
3. Review spam folder instructions
4. Consider SMS delivery option

### Issue: Signed PDFs Not Storing
1. Check Supabase Storage configuration
2. Verify storage bucket permissions
3. Review webhook processing logs
4. Check booking_media insertion errors
