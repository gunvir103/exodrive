## Critical Security Analysis

### üö® PR #32: SECURITY EMERGENCY
**Status:** CRITICAL - DO NOT MERGE TO PRODUCTION

**Critical Vulnerabilities Documented:**
1. **Missing Price Validation** - $1 vs $1000 payment bypass possible
2. **Webhook Security Bypasses** - Fake payment confirmations injectable
3. **Missing RLS Policies** - All pricing data exposed
4. **Anonymous Booking Creation** - System can be flooded
5. **Data Type Issues** - Performance impact from TEXT dates

**The path forward is clear:**
1. **IMMEDIATE**: Fix security vulnerabilities (PR #32)
2. **URGENT**: Resolve payment conflicts (PR #30)  
3. **STRATEGIC**: Deploy performance gains (PR #27, #35)
4. **LONG-TERM**: Execute business strategy (PR #28, #29, #33, #34)

**Success depends on disciplined execution** of the security-first merge strategy outlined above. The potential rewards‚Äî42% performance improvement, $50k+ monthly revenue increase, and systematic process optimization‚Äîjustify the careful, phased approach required.
