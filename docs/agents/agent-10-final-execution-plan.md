## ⚡ IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (NEXT 4 HOURS)

### Hour 1: Emergency Security Patching
```bash
# 1. Create emergency security branch
git checkout -b emergency-security-fixes
git push -u origin emergency-security-fixes

# 2. Immediate price validation fixes
```

**File:** `/lib/stripe/price-validation.ts` (CREATE IMMEDIATELY)
```typescript
export function validatePrice(price: number, productId: string): boolean {
  // Minimum price validation (prevent $0.01 unlimited plans)
  if (price < 100) return false; // $1.00 minimum
  
  // Product-specific validation
  const productLimits = {
    'price_unlimited_monthly': { min: 2999, max: 9999 }, // $29.99-$99.99
    'price_unlimited_yearly': { min: 29999, max: 99999 }, // $299.99-$999.99
  };
  
  const limits = productLimits[productId];
  if (!limits) return false;
  
  return price >= limits.min && price <= limits.max;
}
```

**File:** `/lib/supabase/rls-policies.sql` (IMMEDIATE EXECUTION)
```sql
-- Emergency RLS fix for price manipulation
CREATE POLICY "emergency_price_protection" ON subscriptions
  FOR ALL USING (
    amount >= 100 AND -- Minimum $1.00
    (
      (plan_type = 'unlimited_monthly' AND amount BETWEEN 2999 AND 9999) OR
      (plan_type = 'unlimited_yearly' AND amount BETWEEN 29999 AND 99999)
    )
  );
```

### Hour 2: Merge Conflict Resolution
```bash
# Resolve PR #30 conflicts
git checkout PR-30-branch
git rebase main
# Manual conflict resolution in payment files
git add .
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts for payment improvements"
git push --force-with-lease
```

### Hour 3: Critical Testing Setup
```bash
# Setup test environment
npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react vitest
mkdir -p tests/critical
```

**File:** `/tests/critical/payment-security.test.ts` (CREATE)
```typescript
import { validatePrice } from '@/lib/stripe/price-validation';

describe('Critical Payment Security', () => {
  test('prevents price manipulation attacks', () => {
    expect(validatePrice(1, 'price_unlimited_monthly')).toBe(false);
    expect(validatePrice(2999, 'price_unlimited_monthly')).toBe(true);
    expect(validatePrice(99999, 'price_unlimited_monthly')).toBe(false);
  });
});
```

### Hour 4: Emergency Deployment
```bash
# Deploy security fixes immediately
npm run build
npm run test:critical
git commit -m "EMERGENCY: Fix critical price manipulation vulnerability"
git push origin emergency-security-fixes
# Create emergency PR for immediate review
```
