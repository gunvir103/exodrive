# ExoDrive Application Fixes Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Database Schema Issues (Agent 1)
**Problem**: API queries referenced non-existent columns
- `cars.model` - cars table only has `name` column
- `cars.price_per_day` and `cars.main_image_url` - these are in separate tables
- `payments.payment_method` - payments table doesn't have this column
- `bookings.booking_days`, `bookings.pickup_location`, `bookings.dropoff_location` - these columns don't exist

**Fix**: Updated `/app/api/admin/bookings/route.ts` to:
- Remove reference to `cars.model`
- Join with `car_pricing` and `car_images` tables for pricing and images
- Remove `payment_method` from payments query, added `currency` and `paypal_order_id`
- Calculate `bookingDays` dynamically from start/end dates
- Removed references to non-existent location fields

### 2. Next.js 15 NEXT_REDIRECT Error (Agent 2)
**Problem**: Server actions were catching redirect errors incorrectly
**Fix**: Updated `/app/admin/login/actions.ts` to:
- Remove try-catch blocks around the functions
- Let Next.js handle redirects naturally without catching them

### 3. Middleware Authentication (Agent 2)
**Problem**: Middleware wasn't properly handling admin authentication
**Fix**: Enhanced `/middleware.ts` to:
- Check authentication for admin routes
- Return 401 for unauthenticated API requests
- Redirect to login for unauthenticated page requests

### 4. Configuration Updates (Agent 3)
**Problem**: Deprecated Next.js configuration options
**Fix**: Updated `/next.config.mjs` to:
- Replaced deprecated `images.domains` with `images.remotePatterns`
- Removed deprecated experimental options

### 5. Environment Variables (Agent 3)
**Problem**: Missing required environment variables
**Fix**: Added to `.env.local`:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID` - for PayPal integration
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` - for generating URLs

## Testing Checklist

### ‚úÖ Fixed Issues
- [x] Database queries now use correct column names
- [x] Cars data properly joins with pricing and images tables
- [x] Admin login no longer throws NEXT_REDIRECT errors
- [x] Middleware properly handles authentication
- [x] Next.js configuration updated for v15
- [x] All required environment variables added

### üß™ Manual Testing Steps
1. **Homepage**: Visit http://localhost:3005
   - [ ] Should load without errors
   - [ ] Featured car should display with pricing

2. **Admin Login**: Visit http://localhost:3005/admin/login
   - [ ] Login form should appear
   - [ ] Login with admin credentials should redirect to /admin
   - [ ] Invalid credentials should show error message

3. **Admin Dashboard**: Visit http://localhost:3005/admin
   - [ ] Should load analytics without 403 errors
   - [ ] All sections should be accessible

4. **Admin Bookings**: Visit http://localhost:3005/admin/bookings
   - [ ] Should load bookings list without database errors
   - [ ] Car details should show name and pricing
   - [ ] Payment information should display

5. **Admin Inbox**: Visit http://localhost:3005/admin/inbox
   - [ ] Should load email list without errors
   - [ ] Search and filters should work

### üîç Console Checks
- [ ] No 403 or 500 errors in browser console
- [ ] No database column errors in terminal
- [ ] No NEXT_REDIRECT errors during login

## Remaining Considerations

1. **Admin Role Verification**: Currently checking `user_metadata.role === 'admin'` in login. Ensure admin users have this metadata set.

2. **Database Migrations**: If you need the missing columns, consider creating migrations to add:
   - `booking_days` (computed column)
   - `pickup_location` and `dropoff_location` to bookings table
   - `payment_method` to payments table

3. **Performance**: The car pricing and images joins might benefit from database views or materialized views for better performance.
