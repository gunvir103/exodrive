## üîÑ Smart Architecture Decisions

### Avoiding Database Bloat (Critical for Scalability)
```typescript
// ‚úÖ CORRECT: SEO content strategy
- Static generation for location pages (build time)
- MDX files for blog content (file system)
- Redis for dynamic pricing/availability (cache)
- Supabase for transactions only (lean data)

// ‚ùå WRONG: Database-heavy approach
- Storing SEO content in database
- Blog posts as database records
- Location pages from database queries
- Heavy denormalization
```

### Performance Optimization Strategy
```typescript
// Bundle optimization
- Remove 260KB dead code immediately
- Implement code splitting by route
- Lazy load heavy components
- Use dynamic imports for modals

// Database optimization
- Add 11 critical indexes
- Convert TEXT dates to proper DATE type
- Implement connection pooling
- Use materialized views for reports
```
