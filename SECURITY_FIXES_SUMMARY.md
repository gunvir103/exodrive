# ExoDrive Security Fixes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the critical security fixes implemented to address vulnerabilities in the ExoDrive car rental system where pricing was calculated client-side and payments required manual capture.

## Security Vulnerabilities Fixed

### 1. Client-Side Price Manipulation
**Problem**: The client calculated rental prices and sent them to the PayPal API, allowing potential price manipulation.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Created server-side pricing functions in the database:
  - `calculate_booking_price()` - Calculates prices based on database values
  - `validate_booking_price()` - Validates client-provided prices against server calculations
- Modified API endpoints to use server-side calculations
- Price validation now happens before payment authorization

### 2. Manual Payment Capture
**Problem**: Admin had to manually capture authorized payments, creating operational burden and potential revenue loss.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Created automatic payment capture system with configurable rules
- Payment capture rules table with priorities:
  1. Capture after contract signing
  2. Capture 24 hours before rental
  3. Capture after admin approval
- Automated cron job runs every 15 minutes to process scheduled captures
- Database triggers automatically schedule captures based on booking events

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Changes

#### New Functions
```sql
-- Server-side price calculation
calculate_booking_price(car_id, start_date, end_date) -> {
  success: boolean,
  rental_days: number,
  base_price_per_day: number,
  final_price: number,
  discount_amount: number,
  deposit_amount: number
}

-- Price validation
validate_booking_price(car_id, start_date, end_date, client_price) -> {
  valid: boolean,
  error?: string,
  server_calculation?: object
}

-- Payment capture management
determine_payment_capture_time(booking_id)
process_scheduled_payment_captures()
mark_payment_captured(booking_id, capture_id, amount)
```

#### New Tables
- `payment_capture_rules` - Configurable rules for automatic payment capture
- Added columns to `bookings`:
  - `payment_capture_scheduled_at`
  - `payment_capture_attempted_at`
  - `payment_capture_rule_id`
- Added columns to `payments`:
  - `paypal_capture_id`
  - `captured_amount`
  - `captured_at`

### API Changes

#### Modified Endpoints

1. **POST /api/bookings/create-paypal-order**
   - Now requires: `carId`, `startDate`, `endDate`
   - Calculates price server-side using database function
   - No longer accepts `amount` from client

2. **POST /api/bookings/authorize-paypal-order**
   - Validates client-provided price against server calculation
   - Rejects requests with price mismatches
   - Logs suspicious activity for monitoring

3. **POST /api/admin/process-payment-captures** (New)
   - Cron endpoint for automatic payment capture
   - Processes bookings with scheduled captures
   - Handles PayPal API calls and updates database

### Client-Side Changes

- Modified `CarBookingForm` component:
  - Still displays calculated price for UX
  - Sends car ID and dates instead of price
  - Added comment: "For display only - actual price calculated server-side"

### Security Enhancements

1. **Audit Trail**
   - All price calculations logged in `booking_events`
   - Price mismatch attempts logged for security monitoring
   - Payment capture attempts and results tracked

2. **Database Security**
   - Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all new tables
   - Functions use `SECURITY DEFINER` with proper permissions
   - Search paths fixed to prevent SQL injection

3. **API Security**
   - Server-side validation on all pricing endpoints
   - Rate limiting preserved on payment endpoints
   - Cron job protected with secret token

## Deployment Checklist

### Environment Variables Required
- `CRON_SECRET` - Secret for protecting cron endpoints
- PayPal credentials (already configured)

### Vercel Configuration
Added cron job to `vercel.json`:
```json
{
  "path": "/api/admin/process-payment-captures",
  "schedule": "*/15 * * * *"
}
```

### Testing
- Created integration tests in `tests/integration/security-pricing.test.ts`
- Tests verify:
  - Server-side price calculation
  - Price validation rejects manipulation
  - Payment capture rules are configured

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Key Metrics to Monitor
1. Price validation failures (potential attacks)
2. Payment capture success rate
3. Average time from booking to capture
4. Failed capture attempts

### Admin Actions Required
- Review and adjust payment capture rules as needed
- Monitor for price manipulation attempts
- Handle edge cases where automatic capture fails

## Future Enhancements

1. **Dynamic Pricing**
   - Add support for seasonal pricing
   - Implement surge pricing for high-demand periods

2. **Advanced Capture Rules**
   - Add risk-based capture timing
   - Implement partial capture for long rentals

3. **Enhanced Security**
   - Add rate limiting per user for pricing calculations
   - Implement anomaly detection for suspicious patterns

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, the system can be rolled back by:
1. Reverting API endpoint changes
2. Disabling payment capture cron job
3. Manual capture process remains available as fallback

All database migrations are non-destructive and add new functionality without removing existing capabilities.
