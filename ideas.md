## Part 1: Performance Optimization (MVP - Quick Wins)

### üéØ Critical Performance Issues & Solutions

#### 1. **Bundle Size Crisis** (832+ packages)
**Current State:** Massive dependency footprint causing slow initial loads
**Impact:** 3-5 second longer load times

**Immediate Actions:**
```bash
# Week 1 Sprint
- Remove tsparticles packages (save ~150KB)
- Dynamic import framer-motion (save ~100KB)
- Tree-shake Radix UI components (save ~200KB)
- Implement bundle analyzer
- Target: Reduce bundle by 60% (< 200KB initial)
```

#### 2. **Image Optimization**
**Current State:** Wildcard hostname allowlist, no modern formats

**Quick Fixes:**
```javascript
// next.config.mjs improvements
images: {
  formats: ['image/webp', 'image/avif'],
  minimumCacheTTL: 31536000,
  deviceSizes: [640, 750, 828, 1080, 1200],
  imageSizes: [16, 32, 48, 64, 96],
  remotePatterns: [
    // Replace ** with specific domains
  ]
}
```

#### 3. **Database Query Optimization**
**Current State:** Good connection pooling, but over-fetching

**Optimizations:**
- Implement query result pagination
- Add selective field fetching
- Optimize JOIN queries in car listings
- Enable query result streaming

#### 4. **Caching Strategy Enhancement**
**Current State:** Excellent Redis implementation

**Enhancements:**
```typescript
// Implement edge caching
- Vercel Edge Config for global distribution
- Browser caching headers for static assets
- Service Worker for offline support
- ISR for semi-static pages
```
