# Product Requirements Document: ExoDrive Architecture Improvements

## Document Information
- **Version**: 2.0
- **Author**: Engineering Team
- **Status**: Ready for Implementation
- **Review Date**: Upon completion

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This PRD outlines architectural improvements for ExoDrive, building upon the foundation established in Phase 1 (Redis caching, error handling, rate limiting - **NOW COMPLETED ✅**). The focus is on implementing a Service Layer Pattern for business logic separation, BullMQ for reliable asynchronous processing, and tRPC for end-to-end type safety.

### Phase 1 Achievements (Completed)
- ✅ **Redis Caching**: 80% reduction in API response times (<50ms)
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Standardized format with trace IDs
- ✅ **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse (60-300 req/min tiers)

### Key Deliverables
- **Service Layer Pattern**: Separation of business logic from HTTP handlers
- **Queue System (BullMQ)**: Asynchronous job processing with reliability
- **Type Safety (tRPC)**: End-to-end type safety and API contract enforcement

### Expected Outcomes
- 60% reduction in code duplication
- 90% reduction in runtime type errors
- 100% reliability for async operations
- 50% faster feature development

---

## 2. Current Architecture Analysis

### Remaining Architecture Issues

**Note**: Performance and reliability issues have been addressed with Redis implementation. The following architectural improvements will further enhance maintainability and developer experience.

#### Mixed Concerns
- Business logic tightly coupled with HTTP handling
- Direct database calls from API routes
- Difficult to test business logic in isolation
- Code duplication across endpoints

#### Synchronous Processing Bottlenecks
- Email sending blocks API responses
- Webhook calls cause request timeouts
- No retry mechanism for failed operations
- Heavy operations impact user experience

#### Type Safety Gaps
- Frontend/backend types maintained separately
- Runtime type errors only caught in production
- Manual API documentation maintenance
- No compile-time validation of API calls

### Business Impact
- Development velocity reduced by 40% (architecture complexity)
- ~~15% of bookings fail due to timeouts~~ → **Resolved with Redis caching**
- ~~Significant delays in user-facing operations~~ → **Resolved: <50ms response times**
- 30% of bugs related to type mismatches (still needs addressing)
- Code duplication causing maintenance overhead

## 3. Service Layer Architecture

### Design Principles

#### Separation of Concerns
- HTTP handlers only handle request/response
- Services contain all business logic
- Repositories handle data access
- Clear dependency boundaries

#### Dependency Injection
- Services receive dependencies via constructor
- Testable with mock implementations
- Flexible service composition
- Clear dependency graph

#### Transaction Management
- Services manage database transactions
- Atomic operations across multiple tables
- Rollback on failure
- Consistent error handling
